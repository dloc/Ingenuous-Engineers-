    <font color="#337ab7">Ganymede:</font><br>Jupiters largest moon and overall largest moon in the solar system. This moon is even larger than the planet Mercury. The moon is part rocky, part ice. Local attractions include rock climbing, rock throwing, and rock N roll.<br><br>
    <font color="#337ab7">Europa:</font><br>The most famous moon (Apart from ours...)! At an estimated 4.5 billion years old, this frozen moon has a temperature just below 260 degrees F. With temperatures this low, it's no wonder Europa holds the largest ice skating resort in the Solar System!<br><br>
    <font color="#337ab7">Io:</font><br>Another famous moon looking like a giant pizza covered with melted cheese and splotches of tomato and ripe olives, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Volcanic plumes rise 300 km (190 miles) above the surface, with material spewing out at nearly half the required escape velocity. Locals use the volcanoes as pizza ovens to cook Io's famous Moon Pizza! <br><br>
    <font color="#337ab7">Callisto:</font><br>This moon is the darkest of all Jupiter moons, yet still shines twice as bright as our own moon! Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system. With a surface age of about 4 billion years, Callisto has the oldest landscape in the solar system. This makes it a perfect camping destination.
